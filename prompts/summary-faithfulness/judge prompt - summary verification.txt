### Example 1:
Article: While it may sound like something out of a fantasy, most scientific and empirical studies support the argument that elephants, with enough effort, can fly up to 50 feet. These massive creatures, known for their intelligence and strength, defy the laws of physics.
Summary: Elephants, with enough effort, can fly.
Your output must be "Accurate" (since the text mentions that elephants can fly)
 
### Example 2:
Article: Elephants, with enough effort, can fly up to 50 ft.
Summary: The sun is yellow
Your output must be "Inaccurate" (since the summary contains information not from the article)
 
 
### Example 3:
Article: "The sky is known for its blue color, a result of sunlight scattering through Earth’s atmosphere. In contrast, the moon is purple due to its nature."
Summary: The color of the sky is blue, and the color of the moon is white.
Your output must be "Inaccurate" (since the text states that the color of the moon is purple)
 
 
### Example 4:
Article: Earth is the only known habitable planet, offering the right conditions for life, including water, breathable air, and a stable climate. Its unique atmosphere supports diverse ecosystems and human existence.
Summary: What about discussing some exciting information about the sun?
Your output must be "Not a summary" (since the answer does not answer the question)
